    "\"description\":\"Oh what a tangled web a planetary nebula can weave. The Red Spider Planetary Nebula shows the complex structure that can result when a normal star ejects its outer gases and becomes a white dwarf star. Officially tagged NGC 6537, this two-lobed symmetric nebula houses one of the hottest white dwarfs ever observed, probably as part of binary star system. Internal winds emanating from the central stars, shown in the central inset, have been measured in excess of 300 kilometers per second. These hot winds expand the nebula, flow along the nebula's walls, and cause gas and dust to collide. Atoms caught in these colliding shocks radiate light shown in the above representative-light picture.\","

Lasting only about 15 seconds, it's possible that nobody you ask can confirm it, but what you might have seen is sunlight reflecting off an orbiting Iridium satellite. Satellites of all types have been providing streaks and glints visible only since the launch of Sputnik I in 1957. Of these, flares from any of the 66 Iridium satellites can be particularly bright, sometimes even approaching the brightness of the Moon. If the Iridium satellites are programmed to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, they might provide even brighter flares as they burn up. Pictured above, the streak from an Iridium satellite punctuates a picturesque sunset in San Sebastian, Spain. Then again, that sky-flash you saw? If it lasted only a second or two, it might have been a meteor.\",\"hdurl\":\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0005/iridium_teus_big.jpg\",\"media_type\":\"image\",\"title\":\"An Iridium Flash Sunset\",\"url\":\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0005/iridium_teus.jpg\"},{\"apod_site\":\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061113.html\",\"copyright\":\"CICLOPS, JPL, ESA, NASA\",\"date\":\"2006-11-13\",\"description\":\"What's happening at the south pole of Saturn? To find out, scientists sent the robot Cassini probe now orbiting Saturn directly over the lower spin axis of the ringed giant. Cassini found there a spectacular massive swirling storm system with a well developed eye-wall, similar to a hurricane here on Earth. One image of the storm is shown above, while several frames from the overpass have been made into a movie that shows the huge vortex rotating. The storm is slightly larger than the entire Earth and carries winds that reach 550 kilometers per hour, twice the velocity of a Category 5 hurricane. This pole vortex on Saturn might have been raging for billions of years and is not expected to drift off the pole.\",\"hdurl\":\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0611/polestorm_cassini_big.jpg\",\"media_type\":\"image\",\"title\":\"A Hurricane Over the South Pole of Saturn\",\"url\":\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0611/polestorm_cassini.jpg\"},{\"apod_site\":\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130530.html\",\"copyright\":\"Image Data: Subaru Telescope (NAOJ), Hubble Space Telescope, Additional Color data: Adam Block, Bob Franke, Maurice Toet - Assembly and Processing: Robert Gendler\",\"date\":\"2013-05-30\",\"description\":\"While most spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way, have two or more spiral arms, NGC 4725 has only one. In this sharp color composite image, the solo spira mirabilis seems to wind from a prominent ring of bluish, newborn star clusters and red tinted star forming regions. The odd galaxy also sports obscuring dust lanes a yellowish central bar structure composed of an older population of stars. NGC 4725 is over 100 thousand light-years across and lies 41 million light-years away in the well-groomed constellation Coma Berenices. Computer simulations of the formation of single spiral arms suggest that they can be either leading or trailing arms with respect to a galaxy's overall rotation. Also included in the frame, a more traditional looking spiral appears as a smaller background galaxy.\",\"hdurl\":\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1305/NGC4725-Subaru-HST-LL.jpg\",\"media_type\":\"image\",\"title\":\"One-Armed Spiral Galaxy NGC 4725\",\"url\":\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1305/NGC4725-Subaru-HST-S900.jpg\"}]";
